# Description

The Logo Generator serves as Node.js command-line application that takes user input to generate a logo and saves it as an SVG file. The Logo Generator assists freelance web developers to generate simple logos for projects instead of paying for a graphic designer.
The application uses Inquirer to allow the user is able to input up to three letters for their logo design, select the text colour, the shape and the shape colour.
Each shape class within the application has been tested using Jest.
